## MVVM Clean Architecture

MVVM Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that helps in creating modular, scalable, and maintainable code. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**:
   - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
   - **View**: Represents the UI components of the application.
   - **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View, handling the presentation logic and UI-related tasks.

2. **Clean Architecture**:
   - **Separation of Concerns**: Divides the application into distinct layers (Presentation, Domain, Data) with clear responsibilities, making the codebase more organized and easier to understand.
   - **Dependency Rule**: The inner layers are independent of the outer layers, allowing for easier testing, scalability, and maintenance.
